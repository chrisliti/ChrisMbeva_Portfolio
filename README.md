# [Project 1: Movie Recommender Engine](https://github.com/chrisliti/Movie-Recommender-Engine/blob/master/Movie%20Recommender%20Engine%20June%202021.ipynb)

* Movie recommender engine based on collaborative filtering algorithm.
* Movie recommendations are based on knowledge of user preferences.
* Users rate a movie on a scale of 1-5.
* User ratings are correlated with other movie ratings.
* Algorithm takes input of your favourite movie from catalogue and outputs 10 movies you may enjoy from the catalogue .

# [Project 2: Identifying risky loans](https://github.com/chrisliti/Identifying-Risky-Loans/blob/master/Identifying%20Loan%20Defaulters%20June%202021.ipynb)

* Classification algorithm for identifying risky loans.
* Input file is a csv file of 20 features with target feature denoted by 0 nad 1 with 1 being defaulters.
* Machine learning algorithms utilized are logistic regression and random forest.
* Logistic regression had 74% accuracy whereas random forest attained 75% accuracy.
* Logistic regression had a better recall for risky loans than random forest.

# [Project 3: Natural language Processing - WordCloud visualization and sentiment analysis of tweets.](https://github.com/chrisliti/NLP-Twitter-Analysis/blob/master/NLP%20(Twitter%20Analysis)%20May%202021.ipynb)

* Takes input of key words for subject of interest.
* Pulls most recent tweets (500)from twitter API.
* Cleans text data.
* Visualizes most common words by use of wordclouds and bar graphs - Most frequent words indicate tweets content. A deeper dive can be done on stand out terms.
* Extraction of sentiment and sentiment-based plot arcs from tweets text.
* NRC lexicon is utilized for sentiment analysis - categorizes words in a binary fashion (“yes”/“no”) into categories of positive, negative, anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust. The bing lexicon categorizes words in a binary fashion into positive and negative categories.
